## Dev Notes:
### If I had more time, I would have done diferently that.
- Divide the components in part more littles.
- Added API Autentication.
- Improvement the querys with mongo.
- Of course, add validations in the Frontend part.
- Code testing.

### My minds.
I'm happy with the project code of rect components and that I used mongodb for save the information. Thas was cool, good practice for learn more!!.

I don't like the interface design :(
